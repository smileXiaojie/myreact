This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


此项目基于已经安装 antd 的环境

### `npm install antd --save   ||  yarn add antd`

antd 是基于 Ant Design 设计体系的 React UI 组件库，主要用于研发企业级中后台产品。

### `yarn add react-app-rewired customize-cra`

这里我们使用 react-app-rewired （一个对 create-react-app 进行自定义配置的社区解决方案）。

引入 react-app-rewired 并修改 package.json 里的启动配置。

### `yarn add babel-plugin-import`

babel-plugin-import 是一个用于按需加载组件代码和样式的 babel 插件（原理），现在我们尝试安装它并修改 config-overrides.js 文件。

### `yarn add less less-loader`

antd自定义主题颜色

### `npm install --save react-router-dom`
 
react路由
